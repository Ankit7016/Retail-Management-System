# Retail Management System

## Overview

This Java-based Retail Management System is a console application designed to streamline the operations of an online retail store. It provides essential functionalities for both administrators and customers, facilitating efficient management and smooth user experience.

## Features

- **User Types**: The system accommodates two main user types: administrators and customers. Customers are further categorized into members and non-members.
- **Registration**: Users, both administrators and customers, can register accounts within the system. However, administrators require a special admin key for registration.
- **Product Management**: Administrators have the authority to manage products, including adding new products, adjusting product quantities, and calculating profits.
- **Order Management**: Customers can browse products, make purchases, and cancel orders if needed. Upon purchase, customers can view detailed bills outlining their transactions.
- **Password Reset**: In case users forget their passwords, the system offers a password reset functionality to restore access to their accounts.

## Functionality Details

- **Admin Control**: Administrators can add new products to the system, manage inventory levels, calculate profits, and enforce penalties where necessary.
- **Customer Interactions**: Customers can register accounts, browse available products, make purchases, and view their transaction history.
- **Security Measures**: The system ensures secure registration and authentication processes, including password reset functionality to maintain account access.
- **Efficient Operations**: By centralizing management tasks and providing a user-friendly interface, the system enhances the efficiency of retail operations.

## Future Improvements

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Enhance user experience by transitioning from a console-based interface to a graphical user interface.
- **Expanded User Features**: Introduce additional functionalities such as wishlist management, personalized recommendations, and loyalty programs to further engage customers.
- **Enhanced Reporting**: Implement comprehensive reporting tools to provide administrators with insights into sales trends, inventory performance, and customer behavior.
